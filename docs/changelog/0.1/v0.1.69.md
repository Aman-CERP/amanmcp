# v0.1.69 - 2026-01-09

AI-Native PM session handoff system, release skill, and changelog reorganization.

---

## Added

- ConsistencyChecker for cross-store validation detecting orphaned/missing entries (DEBT-021)
- Index Runner for reusable indexing logic with dependency injection (DEBT-022)
- AllIDs() method to BM25Index and VectorStore interfaces for consistency checking
- QuickCheck (O(1)) and full consistency check on `amanmcp serve` startup
- Automatic repair of orphaned BM25/Vector entries on startup
- Multi-source log viewing with `--source` flag for `amanmcp-logs` (go, mlx, all)
- MLX Python server JSON file logging with rotation (10MB, 5 files)
- Source labels in unified log view ([go] cyan, [mlx] magenta)
- Helpful error messages when log files don't exist (shows how to generate logs)
- MLX settings in config template (`mlx_endpoint`, `mlx_model`)
- AI-Native PM session handoff system with accountability documents (Phase 12)
- Comprehensive AI-Native PM Guide (`.aman-pm/guides/ai-native-pm-guide.md`)
- Quick reference guide for PM commands (`.aman-pm/guides/quick-reference.md`)
- Session handoff template and archive structure (`.aman-pm/sessions/`)
- `/release` skill for version management with changelog automation

## Changed

- Refactor index.go from 917 to ~355 lines (61% reduction) using extracted Runner
- Index command now uses Runner with injected dependencies for better testability
- Default embeddings provider from `ollama` to `""` (auto-detect: MLX → Ollama → Static)
- Default log level from `info` to `debug` for better troubleshooting
- Config template now includes MLX server settings and auto-detection documentation
- MLX embedder timeout handling from fixed 30s to progressive scaling (60-120s)
- MLX embedder now retries failed requests (2 attempts for transient failures)
- Changelog directory structure reorganized by minor version (`docs/changelog/0.1/`)
- `/session-start` skill enhanced to read last session handoff (v3.0.0)
- `/session-end` skill enhanced to generate session handoffs (v3.0.0)
- Backlog items populated with full context from source data (Phase 11 data integrity fix)

## Fixed

- Config init creating `provider: ollama` which bypassed MLX auto-detection
- Config file accumulating duplicate exclude patterns on upgrade
- MLX thermal throttling timeouts during large batch operations
- HTTP client timeout override issue (BUG-052 pattern)
- Config validation now rejects whitespace-only queries (DEBT-019)
- Config validation removes stale "yzma" provider check (DEBT-018)
- Config validation adds edge case checks for negative values and weight sums (DEBT-018)

## Removed

- YzmaEmbedder implementation (internal/embed/yzma.go, yzma_test.go)
- ProviderYzma constant and factory support
- hybridgroup/yzma dependency (replaced by MLX embedder)
- DEBT-023 tech debt item (violated "Do It Now" and "Clean Code" philosophies)

## Documentation

- Updated README with MLX Server section and debugging commands
- Updated mlx-server/README.md with Logging section
- Updated first-time-user-guide with log viewer documentation
- Add technical description and technology catalog (archive/gem_amanmcp_description.md)
- Archive DEBT-016 as complete (debug logging shipped in v0.1.66)
- Archive DEBT-017 as obsolete (USearch removed in v0.1.38)
- Archive DEBT-021 as resolved (ConsistencyChecker implemented)
- Archive DEBT-022 as resolved (Index Runner extracted)
- Archive analysis-2026-01-09-review.md (all items resolved)
- Tech debt reduced from 2 → 0 open items (100% tech debt free)
- Restore 66 historical changelogs to `docs/changelog/0.1/`
- Update CHANGELOG.md index with correct paths after reorganization
- Add skill registry entry for `/release` skill (v3.1.0)
