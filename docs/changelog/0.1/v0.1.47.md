# v0.1.47 (2026-01-05)

## Fixed

- **BUG-037 Permanent Fix**: Add `codesign` after builds to fix macOS Gatekeeper SIGKILL
  - Previous fix (xattr-only) was insufficient for sandboxed app builds
  - Now clears xattrs AND re-signs binary with ad-hoc signature
  - Same fix used by UV Python (astral-sh/uv#16726)
  - Applied to: `build`, `install`, `install-user`, `install-local` targets
