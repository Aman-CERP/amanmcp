## Validated

- **F29: Zero-Friction Startup**
  - Auto-download USearch library (~180KB) on first run
  - Cached library detection skips download on subsequent runs
  - Offline mode error with install instructions when library missing
  - Background indexer with lock file for concurrent access protection
  - Thread-safe IndexProgress tracking with stages (scanning, chunking, embedding, indexing)
  - MCP index_status tool returns progress during indexing
  - Search tool returns "indexing in progress" message during background indexing
  - Unified entry point via `libloader.EnsureLibraryOrReExec()`
  - Re-exec pattern for CGO library path setup
