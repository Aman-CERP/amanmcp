## Quick Summary

- **Embeddings** convert text to numbers that capture meaning
- **Similar texts** have similar numbers (close in vector space)
- **Cosine similarity** measures how close vectors are
- **HNSW** makes searching millions of vectors fast

**Default embedding model:** nomic-embed-text (768 dimensions)
