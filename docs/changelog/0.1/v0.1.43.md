# v0.1.43 (2026-01-05)

## Added

- `amanmcp compact` command to rebuild HNSW index from stored embeddings (zero Ollama calls)
- Embeddings now persisted in SQLite for future compaction (BUG-024 fix)
- Project-level `.amanmcp.yaml` config to exclude historical files from indexing

## Changed

- Consolidate docs/ directory: archive superseded specs to `archive/docs-v1/`, merge session files, flatten sparse directories (17→11 top-level directories)

## Fixed

- BUG-028: Smart gitignore reconciliation - nested .gitignore uses subtree scan only, root .gitignore with ADDED patterns uses pattern diff (no filesystem scan), 10-1000x faster
- BUG-030: Event buffer overflow now logs warnings instead of dropping silently
- BUG-039: Add structured logging to CLI commands (index, search) for observability
- BUG-038: Fix daemon start creating zombie processes (add Wait() to reap child)
