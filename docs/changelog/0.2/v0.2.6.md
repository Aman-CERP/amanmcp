# v0.2.6

**Release Date:** 2026-01-12

---

## Fixed

- **BUG-041**: Prevent silent fallback to Static768 when `AMANMCP_EMBEDDER` is explicitly set
  - When `AMANMCP_EMBEDDER=ollama` or `AMANMCP_EMBEDDER=mlx` is set and the embedder fails, now returns a clear error instead of silently falling back to hash-based static embeddings
  - Auto-detection behavior (no env var set) unchanged - still falls back to static for backward compatibility
  - Increase cold start timeout from 5s to 180s for dimension detection (cold model loads can take 30-60+ seconds)

---

## Upgrade Notes

This is a bug fix release. No breaking changes.

**Behavior Change:** If you explicitly set `AMANMCP_EMBEDDER=ollama` and Ollama is unavailable, the system will now return an error instead of silently falling back to static embeddings. This prevents users from unknowingly using degraded hash-based search.
