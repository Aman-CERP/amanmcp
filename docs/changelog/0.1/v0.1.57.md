# v0.1.57 - UI Redesign & Thermal Fix

Release date: 2026-01-07

## Highlights

- **asitop-inspired CLI UI** - Professional lime green theme, sparkline visualization, speed metrics
- **BUG-058 fix** - HTTP client timeout no longer overrides progressive context timeout

---

## Added

- Add config upgrade with backup (`amanmcp config init --force`)
  - Creates timestamped backup before modifying user config
  - Merges new default options while preserving user customizations
  - Keeps last 3 backups (auto-cleans older ones)
  - Reports which new options were added
  - Auto-runs during `install.sh` for seamless upgrades

- **asitop-inspired CLI UI redesign** for indexing command
  - Lime green color palette (`#AFFF00`) replacing magenta/cyan "typical AI" look
  - Box-drawing borders with rounded corners for polished panel layout
  - Real-time sparkline throughput visualization (Unicode block chars `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`)
  - Speed metrics display: current/avg/peak chunks per second
  - ETA with exponential smoothing for stable estimates
  - Animated spinner on active stage
  - Polished completion screen with box border and stats summary
  - Status bar with warnings/errors count and keyboard hints

## Fixed

- **BUG-058:** Fix HTTP client timeout overriding context timeout at 99% indexing
  - Remove static `http.Client.Timeout` that bypassed progressive timeout
  - Increase default timeouts (warm: 60s→120s, cold: 120s→180s) for thermal throttling
  - Wire config.yaml thermal settings (`timeout_progression`, `retry_timeout_multiplier`) to embedder
  - Add diagnostic logging for embedding attempts and failures

## Documentation

- Add unified Configuration Reference guide (`docs/guides/configuration-reference.md`)
  - Complete list of all 35+ configuration options
  - Tables with YAML keys, types, defaults, ranges, and descriptions
  - Environment variable reference
  - Validation rules and merge behavior
  - Example configurations (minimal, user, project)
