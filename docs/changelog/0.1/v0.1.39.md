# Version 0.1.39

**Release Date:** 2026-01-03
**Phase:** Dogfooding & CI Optimization

---

## Summary

Complete removal of USearch dependencies from the project. This version finalizes the v0.1.38 architecture transition by cleaning up all USearch remnants from build infrastructure, CI workflows, and installation scripts. Also fixes BUG-020 (invalid default embedder config) discovered during dogfooding.

---

## Added

- `.golangci.yml` configuration for consistent linting across local and CI environments

---

## Changed

- **CI Optimization**: Remove redundant Build job from GitHub Actions (test job already compiles)
- **CI Cleanup**: Remove all USearch setup code from CI workflow
- Update Makefile golangci-lint version from v2.1.6 to v2.7.2 (CI parity)
- Remove USearch library setup from Makefile
- Remove USearch from release workflow, goreleaser config, and install/uninstall scripts
- Simplify `.envrc` to only enable CGO for tree-sitter
- Replace deprecated `filepath.HasPrefix` with `strings.HasPrefix` in daemon tests

---

## Fixed

- **BUG-020**: Fix invalid default embedder config - update from `hugot/minilm/384` to `llama/nomic-embed-text-v1.5/768` to match v0.1.38 architecture
- Fix test expectations in `config_test.go` and `index_search_test.go` to match new defaults

---

## Removed

- `lib/` directory containing USearch C library (libusearch_c.dylib, usearch.h)
- `setup-usearch` Makefile target
- USearch CGO environment variables from `.envrc`
- USearch library bundling from release artifacts
