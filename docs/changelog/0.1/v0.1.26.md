## Summary

F25b Adaptive Embedder with Auto-Recovery validated. The embedder now automatically handles model download failures, provides transparent fallback to Static768, and supports background model recovery with exponential backoff.

---

## Validated

- **F25b: Adaptive Embedder (Auto-Recovery)**
  - Immediate startup with Static768 fallback when Hugot unavailable
  - Background recovery with exponential backoff (1s → 512s, max 10 retries)
  - Dimension-safe hot-swap (blocks if dimensions mismatch)
  - Thread-safe with RWLock pattern (100 concurrent calls tested)
  - Graceful shutdown via channel-based signaling
  - BUG-001 fix: search.go uses embedder.Dimensions()
