## Added

- Code Chunker (F07)
  - AST-aware chunking using tree-sitter symbols
  - Context preservation (imports, package declarations)
  - Large function/class splitting with overlap
  - Fallback to line-based chunking for unsupported languages
  - Comprehensive test suite (16 new tests)

## Technical Details

### New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `internal/chunk/types.go` | Added Chunk, ContentType, FileInput, Chunker types |
| `internal/chunk/code_chunker.go` | CodeChunker implementation |
| `internal/chunk/code_chunker_test.go` | 16 new tests |
| `docs/validation/F07-validation.md` | Validation guide with 17 test cases |

### Chunk Types

| Content Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `code` | AST-parsed code with symbol boundaries |
| `text` | Line-based fallback for unsupported languages |

### Chunk Size Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| MaxChunkTokens | 512 | Optimal for 85-90% recall |
| OverlapTokens | 64 | ~12.5% overlap for context |
| MinChunkTokens | 100 | Minimum viable chunk |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | 31 passing (chunk package) |
| Coverage | 89.1% (chunk), 85.4% (overall) |
| Performance | 10 functions in < 1ms |
| Lint | 0 issues |
| Security | No vulnerabilities |

### Context Extraction by Language

| Language | Context Extracted |
|----------|-------------------|
| Go | package clause, import declarations |
| TypeScript/TSX | import statements |
| JavaScript/JSX | import statements |
| Python | import statements, import_from statements |

### Large Symbol Handling

1. If symbol tokens <= MaxChunkTokens: single chunk
2. If symbol tokens > MaxChunkTokens: split by lines with overlap
3. Overlap ensures context continuity between chunks
