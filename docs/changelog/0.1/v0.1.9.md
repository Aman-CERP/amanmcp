## Summary

F10 Static Embedding Fallback validated - provides offline embedding capability when Ollama is unavailable.

---

## Added

- F10: Static Embedding Fallback - offline embedding for first-run experience
  - 256-dimensional vectors (compact, fast)
  - FNV-64 hash for deterministic index mapping
  - Code-aware tokenization (camelCase, snake_case splitting)
  - Stop word filtering (20 programming terms)
  - 3-character n-grams for character-level patterns
  - Token weight: 0.7, N-gram weight: 0.3
  - Thread-safe with sync.RWMutex
  - Zero external dependencies (offline operation)
  - 28 tests with 83.6% coverage

|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Exact symbol search | Good | Static OK |
| Keyword queries | Medium | Static acceptable |
| Semantic queries | Poor | Ollama required |
| Concept matching | Poor | Ollama required |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | 28 passing |
| Coverage (embed) | 83.6% |
| Coverage (overall) | 82.6% |
| Race detector | Clean |
| CI check | PASS |
