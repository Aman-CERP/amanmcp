# v0.3.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-13

---

## Added

- `/aman end --release` flag for session end + release in one command

## Changed

- `/aman groom --resequence` now prompts to apply recommendations (no separate `--apply-resequence` needed)
- `/aman groom` now offers to archive candidates with smart prompt
- `/aman sprint-end` now offers to start next sprint with smart prompt
- `sync` and `archive` are now internal-only (automatic, no manual commands needed)

## Fixed

- **BUG-060**: Config validation rejects 'mlx' as embeddings provider, causing silent fallback to default config and loss of project exclude patterns (MLX indexed 814 files vs Ollama's 602)

## Removed

- `/aman sync` command (now automatic - runs on start/status/end/done/move/add)
- `/aman archive` command (now automatic - runs during sync)
- `/aman groom --apply-resequence` flag (merged into `--resequence`)

## Documentation

- Update `/aman` skill to v1.2.0 with simplification (lazy engineer optimization)
- Update quick-reference.md and ai-native-pm-guide.md to reflect simplified commands
- Update rearchitect-quick-reference.md with correct `/aman arch` commands

---

## Highlights

### BUG-060 Resolution

Root cause identified: `config.Validate()` didn't recognize 'mlx' as a valid embeddings provider. When validation failed, the system silently fell back to default config, losing all project-specific exclude patterns. This resulted in MLX indexing 31% more files than intended.

**Fix:** Added 'mlx' to valid providers in `internal/config/config.go`.

**RCA:** `.aman-pm/postmortems/RCA-017-mlx-config-validation-missing.md`

### Aman Skill Simplification (v1.2.0)

The `/aman` skill now follows the "lazy 3" workflow:
1. `/aman start` - Begin session (auto-syncs)
2. `/aman` - Quick status (auto-syncs)
3. `/aman end` - End session (auto-syncs, auto-archives)

Sync and archive operations are now automatic - no manual commands needed.
