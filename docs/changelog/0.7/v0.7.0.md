# v0.7.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-14

## Summary

Search quality improvements with path-based scoring and test file deprioritization. This release addresses the wrapper vs implementation ranking issue (BUG-066) and ensures consistent search results regardless of limit parameter (BUG-067).

---

## Added

- Test file deprioritization: 0.5x score penalty for test files in search results (FEAT-QI4)
  - Supports Go (`_test.go`), JavaScript/TypeScript (`.test.`, `.spec.`), and Python (`test_*`, `*_test.py`)
  - Applied in all 4 search paths in engine.go
- Path-based scoring: internal/ boosted 1.3x, cmd/ penalized 0.6x (BUG-066)
  - Prioritizes implementation code over CLI wrappers
  - Fixes "Search function" returning cmd/search.go instead of internal/search/engine.go

## Changed

- Multi-query sub-queries now use minimum limit of 50 for better result fusion (BUG-067)
- Increased maxSubQueries from 4 to 8 to include domain-specific patterns

## Fixed

- Multi-query search now returns consistent results regardless of limit parameter (BUG-067)
  - Previously `-n 10` and `-n 50` returned completely different rankings
  - Sub-queries now fetch minimum of 50 results before fusion
- Multi-query consensus no longer favors wrapper files over implementations (BUG-066)
  - Path-based boosting overcomes unfair consensus boost for ubiquitous files
- CI check no longer runs validation tests in parallel mode (BUG-065)
- Update govulncheck to v1.1.4 for Go 1.25 compatibility

---

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes. The new scoring adjustments are automatic and improve search quality for code queries.
