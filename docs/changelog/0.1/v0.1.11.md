# Version 0.1.11

**Release Date:** 2025-12-29
**Phase:** Phase 1B - Core Search (100% complete)

---

## Summary

F12 Vector Store (USearch) validated - **Phase 1B Core Search Complete!**

This checkpoint marks the completion of the entire chunking, embedding, and indexing pipeline. All 7 features of Phase 1B (F06-F12) are now validated.

---

## Added

- F12: Vector Store (USearch) - HNSW approximate nearest neighbor search
  - VectorStore interface: Add, Search, Delete, Contains, Count, Save, Load, Close
  - USearchStore implementation with HNSW algorithm
  - F16 quantization (50% memory reduction, minimal quality loss)
  - Thread-safe with RWMutex (concurrent reads, exclusive writes)
  - Atomic persistence (temp file + rename pattern)
  - Dual ID mapping (string IDs to uint64 keys)
  - ErrDimensionMismatch custom error type
  - 16 tests with 82.8% coverage
